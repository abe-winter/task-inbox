This software is offered under a modified MPL-2.0 license.

Its source code may not be distributed, even in a reduced or compressed form, in a trained machine learning model, unless the following conditions are met:

1. The machine learning model, including but not limited to training + running, hosting and UX, and all tooling and scraping methodology, is open source
1. The entire training corpus is public under an open license (optionally subject to restrictions by rights-holders of the scraped content, but at minimum the corpus must be licensed for training models and ML research)
1. The machine learning model is reproducible -- it can be regenerated from the public corpus. The new weights need not be identical to the old, but the model's outputs for most inputs should be similar
1. Its reproducibility has been verified, i.e. at least one third party has created usable weights from it
1. The weights are public and transparent; they are available for download (optionally charging fair market rates for bandwidth), licensed for free distribution, and if the model is offered as a hosted service, the service for all outputs indicates to end users which versions of the software and weights were used

For all other purposes, the terms of the MPL-2.0 apply:
